# Dispatch-Sharer-System
The failure of communications, particularly related to interoperability, among safety agencies has resulted to the sudden increase in the number of emergencies reported by RTSA and other law enforcement agencies. Zambians count on first responders and public safety personnel to respond to routine and emergency incidents in a timely and effective manner. First responders and public safety personnel are responsible for the protection and security of over 18 Million people, however the safety agencies suffer from barriers of information sharing with other safety agencies and that has impeded the opportunity for interoperability of communications systems in order to share critical information in times of need.
